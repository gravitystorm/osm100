# osm100

I would like to see 100 new OpenStreetMap developers in 2014. This project analyses various source code repositories to measure this goal.

## Projects

OpenStreetMap has a near limitless number of projects which use the data in one way or another. It is a matter of debate which projects are 'OpenStreetMap' projects and which just happen to use OSM data.

The list of projects comes from the OSMF Engineering Working Group documentation survey in October 2013. Perhaps that list needs to be changed?

## Contributors

It's hard to figure out automatically who is who from git commits. I'm using the email address as a reasonable proxy, but this might lead to 'new' contributors who are in fact the same people with different addresses.

Let's not get too hung up on the details though - if we're arguing whether 15 should actually be 13 it's better to gain another 80 genuine new people instead!
